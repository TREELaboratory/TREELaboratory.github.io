	abstract = {Naming conventions are generally adopted in an effort to improve program comprehension. Two of the most popular conventions are alternatives for composing multi-word identiÔ¨Åers: the use of underscores and the use of camel casing. While most programmers have a personal opinion as to which style is better, empirical study forms a more appropriate basis for choosing between them.},
